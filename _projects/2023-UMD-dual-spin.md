This goal of this project is to analyze the motion of a torque-free rigid body and determine its trajectory in the inertial frame. <br /><br /> ![](http://yi-hsuan-chen.github.io/files/dual_spin.gif)

## Motivation
According to the intermediate axis theorem aka tennis racket theorem, rotation of an object around its intermediate is **unstable**. This effect may cause the satellite flip around, thus resulting in undesirable behavior or even crash. In this project, we explore the concept of dual-spin stabilization, which builds on the stability analysis of torque-free rotation.

## Methodology
Dual-spin stabilization is a method of stabilizing a spacecraftâ€™s orientation in space by adding a rotor/flywheel inside of the spacecraft. Our goal is to achieve stable spinning of the spacecraft around an intermediate axis by introducing a flywheel spinning at the proper speed.

## Motivation
Reduced-G atmospheric flight has attracted great attention from researchers and engineers around the world over past decades. Microgravity environment has a wide range of potential application, such as astronaut training and scientific research in weightlessness or at partial-g levels. Aircraft parabolic flight is a cost-effective way to create weightless or reduced-g conditions in short duration, serving as a tool to investigate phenomena in the absence of gravity. It is expected that microgravity research will become more and more popular as the interests on space and extra-terrestrial planetary exploration increase.  

However, the parabolic maneuvers require higher demand for piloting technique, for example, the [Airbus A310 Zero G](https://www.airzerog.com/) is simultaneously controlled by three members of flight crew, one controls the pitching, the second one controls the rolling to keep the wings level, and the third one is charge of controlling engine thrust and monitoring the flight parameters. Obviously, a well-designed flight control algorithm can improve flight mission safety and efficiency and relieve pilotsâ€™ load.

<!-- ## Current Progress
We present a longitudinal flight control algorithm to direct the aircraft to achieve microgravity through parabolic flights. The controller designed makes an aircraft follow the desired aerodynamic velocity and flight path angle generated from projectile motion. As an aircraft flies along the parabolic flight path, it will be in a free-fall stage, thus causing the sensation of weightlessness. A novel method is proposed for rejecting unknown and quadratically increasing (in time) aerodynamic drag using tripe-integral control based on internal model principle (IMP). The LQR-based controller is used to track flight path angle during parabolic flight. -->

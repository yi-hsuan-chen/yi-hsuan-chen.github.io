## Conclusion
From the above video, we can find that the quadrotor is able to track desired trajectory when fault-tolerance control is engaged. The yaw control is sacrificed to maintain the controllability of x, y, and z directions. In this project, I was mainly charge of testing flight simulator, collecting data, and presenting our research results to collaborators every week.

permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Parabolic flights are one way to simulate
microgravity on Earth, which can be achieved by making aircraft follow specific
flight trajectories. This work describes a kinematic and dynamic analysis of general
partial gravity cases and develops a flight control framework for a zero-gravity
flight using a proof-mass-tracking approach. A triple-integral control structure is adopted to overcome unknown, quadratically
increasing drag. Furthermore, to avoid the
non-minimum phase characteristics of aircraft longitudinal dynamics, the position
deviation from the inertial reference is redefined such that the closed-loop system
is minimum phase.'

Reduced-gravity environments created by airplanes have a wide range of potential appli-cations, such as astronaut training and scientific research in zero- or partial- gravity levels.Reduced-gravity flights, casually called parabolic flights, can be achieved by making aircraftfollow specific trajectories. This work describes the physics behind reduced-gravity flightsand develops a flight control framework for a zero-gravity flight using a proof-mass-trackingapproach. During the zero-gravity parabola phase, aircraft has a zero local (non-gravitational)acceleration and be in a state of free-fall, thus causing the sensation of weightlessness. Hence,the control objective is to simultaneously compensate for aerodynamic drag using thrust controland to make lift force zero by regulating the aircraft with the elevator. A triple-integral controlstructure is adopted to overcome the unknown drag that is expected to grow quadratically withtime. Moreover, the position deviation from the reference object is measured in the cockpitto enable a better control performance. Flight simulations are performed and visualized toillustrate the proposed control strategy.

title: "Control Barrier Functions via Minkowski Operations for Safe Navigation among Polytopic Sets"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics.  In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles.'

This work is inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm; We formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the $\mathcal{MD}$-space). By leveraging the geometric properties of the $\mathcal{MD}$-space, we show that the derivatives of the implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) can be efficiently computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two dynamical systems: (i) single-integrator and (ii) unicycle models, showcasing its capability to maintain safety for non-spherical robots in tight spaces.
